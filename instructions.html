                            Grab a friend and sit down together to play Racers, the most accurate racing sim on the planet.<br> 
                            The two of you will pilot race-cars through hairpin turns and hair-raising courses.<br>
                            Compete to see who will be the true RACER.<br>
                            <br>
                            Racers is a turn-based racing game where speed and momentum matter. Each turn, both players will select a <br>
                            direction to accelerate using their corresponding keyboard keys. <br>
                            <br>
                            Players each will have a bar showing their status. <br>
                            Gray will indicate that no accleration has been chosen for the turn yet. <br>
                            Green shows the player has locked in their choice for the turn. <br>
                            Orange indicates a crash. The player will lose their next turn and be reset to their previous position. <br>
                           <br>
                            Be speedy, be wily, but most of all, be careful not to crash! <br>
                            Will you master the art of the drift, or suffer a fate worse than death -- Second Place?
