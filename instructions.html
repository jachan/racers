                        Grab a friend and sit down together to play Taking Turns, the most thrilling racing sim on the planet.<br> 
                        The two of you will pilot race-cars through hairpin turns and hair-raising courses.<br>

                        <br>
                        Taking Turns is a turn-based racing game where speed and momentum matter. Each turn, both players will select a <br>
                        direction to accelerate using their corresponding keyboard keys. <br>
                        <br>
                        Players each will have a bar showing their status. <br>
                        - Gray indicates that no accleration has been chosen for the turn yet. <br>
                        - Green indicates that the player has locked in their choice for the turn. <br>
                        - Orange indicates a crash. The player will lose their next turn and be reset to their previous position. <br>
                       <br>
                        Be speedy, be wily, but most of all, be careful not to crash! <br>
                        Will you master the art of the drift, or suffer a fate worse than death -- Second Place?
